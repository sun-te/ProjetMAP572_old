	-Adjacency : Adjacency matrix generator from different methods
	-Cluster   : For part 3 of the project, It contains functions K_MEANS and spectral clustering
	-Graph     £ºClass defination with several methods: Visualization, Optimization of the pyhsical graph
	-PageRank  £ºFor the part 4 of the project

			Restructed the whole project with a clearer file structure;
	11/22 11:48: TeTe 
			Fixed some bugs..
			modified some name of the file and function: Visual -> Graph to avoid the ambiguous between the class and function "Visual"; Graph.py ->Adjacency.py
		        Rest the K_means methods with a random initialization to prevent empty clustering.
